# KTVcalculator

This is a tool for selecting appropriate [Karaoke box (or KTV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke_box) in Taipei, Taiwan.

Also, this is one of the gadgets in the KTV information platform: [KTV in Taipei](https://evanyo25.github.io/dPD_ktv/index.html), a term project of a course "Applications for Computer Programming", National Taiwan University (NTU).

    Please forgive my typo of the name of this repository.
    The typo is left unfixed to run the platform (KTV in Taipei) which is held by my collaborator.

* There are two common kinds of charging standards of KTV: 
  * **Counting Noses**
  * **Box**
* The charge in the morning often differs from that in the afternoon / at night and / late at night.
* Various discounting rates and coupons exist.
* Given the charging standards and entertaining features of KTVs are intricate and confusing in Taipei, a transparent a multifunction platform is needed.
